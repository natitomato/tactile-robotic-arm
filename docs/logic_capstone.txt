arduino waits for serial data from rpi
rpi camera outputs an image every loop
vaishnavi code analyses and gives coordinates of orange if exists, else gives orange not found error
use coordinates and tell whether to move L, R, U or D depending on the centre offset of the picture frame
outputs command on terminal (we are not sending command to arduino because we are not implementing the motor actuating part we can manually
 show the movements)
arduino checks serial data and performs the necessary movements (i.e, manually moving L, R, U or D)
once it is centered rpi send a serial command to the arduino to start the lidar
rpi waits for arduino to send serial data
arduino send distance value, rpi does calculations and checks whether it is close enough,
							if yes then it sends command to servo to start closing the end effector
							if no then it tells arduino to switch on lidar again (after which the arudino will send data back)
everytime arduino sends data to rpi, it also sends strain gauge data (load on end effector).
rpi tells servo to stop at some threshold we will have to set and also gives command to the other servo to rotate the entire gripper
after rotation the end effector is released, orange is dropped.
rpi continues to look for next orange.


(Some computations might need to be done in the arduino itself since we don't have time to port some C libraries to python, it might be a
better practice to do it anyways on the arduino since the python script might take a while to run all the object detection code and whatnot,
the arduino can simply do the gripping part on it's own, and provide the rpi with the sensor data for analyzing with the only output being
sending the coordinates and lidar initialization command.)
